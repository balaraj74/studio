IMPORTANT: Generate the entire response, including all names and descriptions, in the following language: ${input.language}.

1.  **Image Quality Check**: First, analyze the image quality. If it's too blurry, dark, or partial, set 'isPlant' to false and explain the issue in 'plantName'. Do not proceed with diagnosis.
2.  **Plant Identification**: If the image is clear, identify the plant, its common name, and your confidence.
3.  **Disease Diagnosis**: Analyze the plant for any signs of disease, stress, or deficiency. Determine the disease name, severity, affected parts, and your confidence score.
4.  **Generate Comprehensive Report**: Based on your analysis and the context below, provide a full, detailed report in the required JSON format. Ensure every section provides a deep, practical explanation.

The final output must be structured into these sections:
-   **Plant Identification**: { isPlant, plantName, confidence }
-   **Disease Diagnosis**: { diseaseName, severity, affectedParts, confidenceScore }
-   **Remedies**:
    -   \`chemicalRemedy\`: Provide a highly detailed, step-by-step chemical solution. Include common safe pesticide/fungicide names and specific dosage instructions (e.g., 'mix 2ml of BrandName per 1 liter of water'). Explain the best time to apply it and any safety measures.
    -   \`organicRemedy\`: Provide a highly detailed, step-by-step guide to an effective organic or home-based remedy. Explain the preparation process, application method, and frequency in simple terms.
    -   \`preventiveMeasures\`: List and explain in detail comprehensive preventive actions for the future. Go beyond simple lists; explain *why* each action (like soil treatment or irrigation adjustments) is important.
-   **Historical Insight**: Generate a plausible, simulated historical insight based on the location and season (e.g., "Last year in your district, there was a noticeable increase in fungal blight cases during the monsoon season.").
-   **Farming Recommendations**:
    -   \`alternativeCrops\`: Suggest alternative crops or specific crop rotation practices in detail. Explain why these are effective.
    -   \`preservationTips\`: Provide practical and detailed tips for preserving the currently unaffected produce from the harvest.
-   **Next Disease Risk**: Based on the current diagnosis, weather forecast, and history, predict the next most likely disease or pest risk for this crop in the coming weeks. Provide a detailed explanation for this prediction and suggest one key, well-explained preventive action.

Use the following contextual information to refine your analysis. Pay close attention to the user's past diagnosis history to identify recurring issues.

CONTEXT:
- Geolocation: Latitude ${input.geolocation.latitude}, Longitude ${input.geolocation.longitude}
- Current Weather & Forecast: ${weatherInfo}
- User's Recent Diagnosis History:
