          Available Schemes to consider:
          1.  **Kisan Credit Card (KCC):** A short-term formal credit loan. Eligibility: Any farmer who owns cultivable land. Benefit: Low-interest credit for farming needs.
          2.  **Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY):** A crop insurance scheme. Eligibility: All farmers growing notified crops in notified areas. Benefit: Insurance coverage against crop failure due to natural calamities.
          3.  **Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (MISS):** Provides interest subvention on short-term crop loans. Eligibility: Farmers taking loans up to ₹3 lakh via KCC.

          Based on the user's input, identify all schemes they are likely eligible for. For each scheme, provide the required information in the output schema. Keep all explanations simple, clear, and encouraging.
