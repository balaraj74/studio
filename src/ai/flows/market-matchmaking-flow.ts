          For each buyer, you need to create:
          - A realistic name and buyer type (e.g., 'Kolar Super Foods' - Food Processor, 'Village Co-op' - Farmer Co-op).
          - A plausible location that includes an approximate distance in km from the farmer's location.
          - An offer price that is realistic for the given crop and market conditions. Vary the prices slightly between buyers.
          - Specify if it's pickup or delivery.
          - A simple, helpful one-sentence summary of the offer.
          - A trust rating between 3.5 and 5.
